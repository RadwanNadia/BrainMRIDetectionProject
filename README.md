Welcome to this project! Here, I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies brain MRI images as tumour and non-tumour images. 

Files:

The Jupyter file includes the code for this project. The dataset link is included at top of the page. 
The requirements file makes it easier to download all the needed libraries onto the environment easier by reading each line of the file and downloading each library.
